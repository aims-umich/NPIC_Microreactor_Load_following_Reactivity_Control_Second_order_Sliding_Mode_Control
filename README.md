Microreactor Load-following Reactivity Control with a Second-order
Sliding Mode Control

Second-order super-twisting sliding mode control application to Microreactor Load-following Reactivity Control

Paper

The simulation is conducted in MATLAB and Python simulation environment.

MATLAB Version 

The MATLAB version has two files. They are STC.m and PID.m
Each file is run individually to generate the results in the paper.
Users must select the number of control drums to be used during the simulation.


Python Version 
The Python version contains a a folder with four files: 
1. run.py
2. controller.py
3. plot.py
4. reactor.py

Users can run the simulation using run.py after selecting the required number of drums.
